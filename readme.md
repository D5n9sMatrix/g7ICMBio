Determinants and Diagonalization
A square matrix is called a lower triangular matrix if all entries above the main diagonal are zero (as in Example 3.1.9). Similarly, an upper triangular matrix is one for which all entries below the main
diagonal are zero. A triangular matrix is one that is either upper or lower triangular. Theorem 3.1.4 gives an easy rule for calculating the determinant of any triangular matrix. The proof is like the solution
to Example 3.1.9.
